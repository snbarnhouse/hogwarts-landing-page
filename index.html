        Founded in the 10th century by
        <em
          >Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar
          Slytherin</em
        >, Hogwarts was established in the Highlands of Scotland to educate
        young wizards and witches as well as to keep students safe from muggle
        prosecution. Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name
        of Hogwarts after dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a
        lake. Since then, Hogwarts educated most wizarding children in the
        United Kingdom and its surrounding areas, keeping its location hidden
        from other wizarding schools and muggles.
